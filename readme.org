Or, how I learned to stop worrying and become a robot.

* TODO What this?

I first became interested in shortcuts when I lost almost $1000 in commission because I clicked the wrong button in SalesForce. It wasn't about speed as much as the mouse's lack of precision.

I decided that every day I would learn 1 shortcut and force myself to use it all day, even if it made me temporarily slower.


* TODO Content

** General Suggestions

*** How to learn these

- Sticky notes are clutch. Force yourself to look at them by putting them in obnoxious places
- Learn 1 at a time
- Be okay with moving slower for a bit
- This is an investment in your time!

*** Escape key

If you're not using the escape key, you might underestimate just how damn useful it is.

Problem is, it's hard to reach.

/Home row philosophy:/ Prefer shortcuts that don't require you to stretch

/A popular fix:/ Remap =Caps Lock= to =Escape=.

*Example:* [[http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/publishers][Searching in Marketplace]]

** Finder

See the Chrome section, as many of the shortcuts there cross-apply

| Shortcut                  | Effect                          |
|---------------------------+---------------------------------|

| Cmd + I                   | Get Info                        |
| Opt + ↑ / ↓               | Go to Top / Bottom of File List |
| Start Typing Name of File | Go to That File                 |


** Chrome

There are a ton, and I'm sure y'all already use many of them so I'll just focus on the ones that I wished I'd known about sooner. [[https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl%3Den][Here's a list of all Chrome shortcuts]] if you're looking for something specific.

*** General Chrome Shortcuts

| Shortcut              | Effect                                                   |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| Cmd + Shift + [ or ]  | Move 1 Tab Left / Right                                  |
| Cmd + `               | Switch Between Windows                                   |
| Cmd + Shift + N       | Open Incognito Tab                                       |
| Cmd + Shift + T       | Open Last Closed Tab                                     |
| Tab / Shift + Tab     | Move to next/previous input                              |
| Cmd + y               | Open History                                             |
| Cmd + Shift + j       | Open Downloads                                           |
| Cmd + ,               | Open Chrome Preferences (works in many apps, e.g. Slack) |
| Cmd + d               | Bookmark page                                            |
| Space / Shift + Space | Page up / down                                           |

*** Address bar

| Shortcut            | Effect                         |
|---------------------+--------------------------------|
| Ctrl + n            | Move to next search prediction |
| Ctrl + p            | Move to prev search prediction |
| Shift + fn + Delete | Delete prediction              |

*** Developer tools:

| Shortcut      | Effect                                           |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| Cmd + Alt + i | Open/close dev console                           |
| Cmd + [ or ]  | Move between tabs in dev console (when selected) |
| Cmd + Alt + u | View source in new tab                           |

*** Chaining commands together

This is really dependent on your workflow. An example of something I do in Marketplace when searching for a pub:

| Cmd + F =<your search>= + Esc + Shift+Enter | Find link, open in new tab (search pub in MP) |

*** Notes

1. One thing that drives me nuts is accidentally quitting Chrome with =Cmd + q= when you meant to close a window with =Cmd + w=. If this is you, I recommend turning on the "Warn before quitting" feature.
2. Some of these also apply to Finder (for example, =Cmd + `= to switch between your open windows).
3. If you want to go further than your browser's native shortcuts, I recommend checking out [[https://vimium.github.io/][Vimium]] or [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/surfingkeys/gfbliohnnapiefjpjlpjnehglfpaknnc?hl%3Den-US][Surfing Keys]], which are Chrome extensions. I personally use Vimium and love it!
4. Usually the =Shift= key acts as a command modifier (for example, open last closed tab or open incognito tab).


** Sheets

These are the newest to me, and a lot are somewhat hard to find online.

Share any you have with me and I'll update this list! :)

| Shortcut                 | Effect                     |
|--------------------------+----------------------------|
| Shift + Space            | Select Row*                |
| Ctrl + Space             | Select Column*             |
| Cmd + Opt + -            | Delete Row                 |
| Cmd + Opt + +            | Insert Blank Row           |
| Fn + ↑ / ↓               | Page up / down             |
| Enter (in cell)          | Edit Text Area**           |
| Fn + Shift + Cmd + ↑ / ↓ | Move Left/Right 1 Sheet    |
| Shift + Opt + S          | Open Sheet Options Dialog  |
| Ctrl + Opt + F           | Open "File" Menu Dialog*** |

 *   Hit twice to toggle selection area
 **  Useful for formulas, in depth editing
 *** Then use =Shift + <First Letter>= to select menu option


** Freshdesk

*** Overview

Freshdesk shortcuts are very similar to Gmail shortcuts (although the best Gmail shortcuts need to be manually turned on before they will work).

Both allow you to access the keyboard shortcuts menu by hitting =?=, and both allow you to focus the searchbar with =/=. These are fairly common conventions across applications that prioritize shortcuts.

Both Gmail and FD preface much of their navigation-based shortcuts with =g=. For example, in Gmail to *go* to your *drafts*, you hit =gd=. In FD to *go* to your *dashboard* or your *tickets* tab, you do =gd= or =gt= (see "GO" section below).

In both FD and gmail you have replying and forwarding of tickets or emails with =r= and =f=.

[[https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/186758-using-keyboard-shortcuts-in-your-support-portal][Here's a link to shortcuts in Freshdesk]]. They actually look really well thought out. To see keyboard shortcuts in Gmail, just press =?= from your inbox.

If anybody wants to talk more about Gmail shortcuts, feel free to talk to me after. I find that finding the right combination can be difficult depending on your particular use-case. For example, in my junk email I often want to mark an entire page of emails as "read", which I can do with =* a <Shift + i>=, then =* n= to deselect them all again.


*** "GO"

*Freshdesk Go Commands:*

| Shortcut | Effect               |

*** All Tickets View

**** Navigating and selecting

If you want to string shortcuts together to create a workflow, this is where you start.

*Freshdesk:*

| Shortcut | Effect                     |
|----------+----------------------------|
| j / ↓    | Move cursor to next ticket |
| k / ↑    | Move cursor to prev ticket |
| x        | Select/deselect ticket     |

*Gmail:*

Same as above, plus:

| Shortcut | Effect                            |
|----------+-----------------------------------|
| * a      | Select all emails                 |
| * n      | Select "no" emails (deselect all) |

**** Do something with selected tickets/emails

You've selected one or more tickets or emails with =x=. Now, do something with them:

*Freshdesk:*

| Shortcut | Effect           |
|----------+------------------|
| s        | Execute scenario |
| ~        | Close            |
| @        | Assign to me     |
| !        | Mark as spam     |
| #        | Delete           |

*Gmail:*

| Shortcut    | Effect         |
|-------------+----------------|
| <Shift> + i | Mark as read   |
| <Shift> + u | Mark as unread |
| !           | Mark as spam   |
| #           | Delete         |


*** Ticket / Email Details View

This is when you have a ticket or an email open (but are not in the input box):

*Freshdesk:*

| Shortcut | Effect                    |
|----------+---------------------------|
| r        | Reply                     |
| f        | Forward                   |
| @        | Assign ticket to yourself |
| ~        | Close ticket              |
| !        | Mark ticket as spam       |
| #        | Delete ticket             |
| }        | See all ticket activity   |
| j        | Open next ticket          |
| k        | Open prev ticket          |

When your cursor is in the input box:

| Shortcut    | Effect                        |
|-------------+-------------------------------|
| <Escape>    | Cancel/close out of input box |
| Cmd + Enter | Send current response         |

*Gmail:*

Almost identical to Freshdesk (minus things like assigning a ticket).


** Periscope

| Shortcut        | Effect           |
|-----------------+------------------|
| Cmd + /         | Toggle Comment   |
| Cmd + Shift + L | Auto-format Code |
| Cmd + Enter     | Run Query        |
