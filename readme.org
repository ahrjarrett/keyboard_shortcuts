** General Suggestions

*** How to learn these

- Sticky notes are clutch
- Learn 1/day
- Be okay with moving slower for a bit
- This is an investment that pay dividends for as long as your career requires you use a computer

*** Escape key

If you're not using the escape key, you probably underestimate how useful it is. Problem is, it's hard to reach.

/Home row philosophy:/ Prefer shortcuts that don't require you to stretch

/A popular fix:/ Remap Caps Lock to Escape. I did this and never looked back

*Example:* [[http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/publishers][Searching in Marketplace]]
