* TODO Background

I first became interested in shortcuts when I lost ~$1000 in commission because I clicked the wrong button in SalesForce. From then on I decided that every day I would replace 1 action that I usually performed by mouse with a keyboard shortcut.

** General Suggestions

*** How to learn these

- Sticky notes are clutch
- Learn 1/day
- Be okay with moving slower for a bit
- This is an investment that pay dividends for as long as your career requires you use a computer

*** Escape key

If you're not using the escape key, you probably underestimate how useful it is. Problem is, it's hard to reach.

/Home row philosophy:/ Prefer shortcuts that don't require you to stretch

/A popular fix:/ Remap Caps Lock to Escape. I did this and never looked back

| Cmd + Opt + -            | Delete Row                 |
| Cmd + Opt + +            | Insert Blank Row           |
| Fn + ↑ / ↓               | Page up / down             |

 *** Then use =Shift + <First Letter>= to select menu option

** Freshdesk

Freshdesk shortcuts are very similar to Gmail shortcuts (although the best Gmail shortcuts need to be manually turned on before they will work).

Both allow you to access the keyboard shortcuts menu by hitting =?=, and both allow you to focus the searchbar with =/=. These are fairly common conventions across applications that prioritize shortcuts.

Both Gmail and FD preface much of their navigation-based shortcuts with =g=. For example, in Gmail to *go* to your *drafts*, you hit =gd=. In FD to *go* to your *dashboard* or your *tickets* tab, you do =gd= or =ga=.


In both FD and gmail you have replying and forwarding of tickets or emails with =r= and =f=.

[[https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/186758-using-keyboard-shortcuts-in-your-support-portal][Here's a link to shortcuts in Freshdesk]]. They actually look really well thought out. To see keyboard shortcuts in Gmail, just press =?= from your inbox.

If anybody wants to talk more about Gmail shortcuts, feel free to talk to me after. I find that finding the right combination can be difficult depending on your particular use-case. For example, in my junk email I often want to mark an entire page of emails as "read", which I can do with =* a <Shift + i>=, then =* n= to deselect them all again.
